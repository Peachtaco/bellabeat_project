    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, I will be analyzing a public dataset using SQL for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I'll be looking at smart device data to gain insight on how consumers use their smart devices and provide recommendations to the Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellabeat was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur with the goal of developing beautifully designed technology that would inform and inspire women.

    "**Bellabeat Products**\n",
    "- Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n",
    "- Leaf: A wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip and connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n",
    "- Time: A wellness watch with smart technology and connects to the Bellabeat app to track user activity, sleep, and stress.\n",
    "- Spring: A water bottle with smart technology and connects to the Bellabeat app to track daily water intake.\n",
