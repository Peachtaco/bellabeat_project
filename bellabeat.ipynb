    "\n",
    "In this case study, I will be analyzing a public dataset using SQL for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I'll be looking at smart device data to gain insight on how consumers use their smart devices and provide recommendations to the Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellabeat was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur with the goal of developing beautifully designed technology that would inform and inspire women. The technology would collect data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with knowledge about their own health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellabeat products are available at a number of online retailers in addition to their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media such as radio, billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. They have ads on Youtube and Google, and are active on multiple social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n",

    "**Bellabeat Products**\n",
    "- Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n",
    "- Leaf: A wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip and connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n",
    "- Time: A wellness watch with smart technology and connects to the Bellabeat app to track user activity, sleep, and stress.\n",
    "- Spring: A water bottle with smart technology and connects to the Bellabeat app to track daily water intake.\n",
