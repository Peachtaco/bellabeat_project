    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, I will be analyzing a public dataset using SQL for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I'll be looking at smart device data to gain insight on how consumers use their smart devices and provide recommendations to the Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n",
