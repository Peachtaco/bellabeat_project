# Bellabeat Project
This is a data analytics project conducted by Bellabeat to explore user smart device activity. The project utilized SQL and Tableau to extract and transform raw logs into a suitable format for analysis and to visualize the data in interactive dashboards. The analysis revealed insights such as the most common activity types, the average duration of device sessions, the most active time of day, and the differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends. The results can be used by Bellabeat to inform product development, marketing strategies, and user engagement efforts.
